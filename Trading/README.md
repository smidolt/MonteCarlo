## Monte Carlo Trading Simulations

Welcome to the Monte Carlo Trading Simulations repository! Here, you will find a collection of Monte Carlo simulations used in trading. Each folder corresponds to a specific asset, and the simulations are designed to provide insights into potential price movements and risks.

### Folder Structure

The repository contains the following folders:

1. **TSLA(16.09.2011)-(16.09.2014)**: This folder contains Monte Carlo simulations specifically designed for the asset "Tesla Inc." (TSLA) from September 16, 2011, to September 16, 2014. These simulations showcase the functioning of the model and its application to historical data. You can explore this folder to understand how the simulations work.

2. **BTC(23.07.2023)-(23.07.2023)**: This folder contains Monte Carlo simulations for the asset "Bitcoin" (BTC) from July 23, 2023, to July 23, 2023. Please note that these simulations are currently in development and are not yet ready for real-world usage. However, you can still explore this folder to get an idea of how the simulations will be utilized once completed.

### Simulation Details

Each asset folder contains Python scripts that simulate the price movements of the respective asset using the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model. The simulations consider historical returns, volatility, and other relevant parameters to model the potential future price trajectories.

### Usage

You can navigate into each asset folder to find the Python scripts for the specific simulations. Run the scripts to perform the Monte Carlo simulations and visualize the price movements. Feel free to modify the simulation parameters and time periods to explore different scenarios.

Please keep in mind that the BTC simulations are still under development, and they are not suitable for real-world applications yet.
