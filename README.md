# Monte Carlo Simulations Repository
Hey there! Welcome to the Monte Carlo Simulations repository. This was originally intended to be a private directory, but I've decided to make it public to share these simulations with you all.
## Description
This repository contains a collection of Monte Carlo simulations, which are widely used in various fields to model and analyze complex systems and processes. The simulations are organized into two main folders:

Random Simulations: In this folder, you'll find a variety of Monte Carlo simulations that cover diverse scenarios and experiments. These simulations are meant to explore random processes and their outcomes.
Trading Simulations: The second folder is dedicated to Monte Carlo simulations related specifically to trading strategies and financial modeling. If you're interested in the world of finance and trading, you'll find some valuable insights here.
## How to Navigate
Each folder contains individual simulation projects. Inside each project folder, you'll find a detailed README file. 
The README file describes the specific simulation and its objectives. It's a great place to start if you want to understand the purpose and context of each simulation.
